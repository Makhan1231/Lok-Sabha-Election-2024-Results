# Election 2024 Lok Sabha Data Analysis

## Overview
This project is designed to analyze the election results for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in India. The analysis is performed using Python, with the help of popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset used in this project contains information about various constituencies, leading and trailing candidates, their respective parties, margins of victory, and the status of the results.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Statistical analysis of election results
- Data visualization using graphs and charts
- Identification of voting trends and patterns

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebook:
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- NumPy

## Datasets

The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named election_results_2024.csv. It contains the following columns:
- Constituency: The name of the constituency.
- Const. No.: The constituency number.
- Leading Candidate: The name of the leading candidate.
- Leading Party: The party of the leading candidate.
- Trailing Candidate: The name of the trailing candidate.
- Trailing Party: The party of the trailing candidate.
- Margin: The margin of victory.
- Status: The status of the result (e.g., "Result Declared").

## Key Functions and Methods

- pd.read_csv('election_results_2024.csv'): Loads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- data.head(10): Displays the first 10 rows of the dataset.
- data.groupby('Leading Party')['Margin'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False): Groups the data by the leading party and calculates the total margin of victory for 
  each party.
- data.loc[data['Margin'].idxmax()]: Identifies the row with the highest margin of victory.
- data.loc[data['Margin'].idxmin()]: Identifies the row with the lowest margin of victory.
- sns.barplot(x=party_votes.index, y=party_votes.values): Plots the number of seats won by each party using a bar plot.

## Project Structure
The analysis follows these main steps:
- Data Collection and Import
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of Election Results
- Key Insights and Conclusion

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if available).
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Election\ 2024\ Loksabha.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells sequentially to see the analysis results.

## Conclusion
This project provides a basic analysis of the 2024 Lok Sabha election results. It demonstrates how to load, inspect, and analyze election data using Python. The analysis can be extended further by exploring additional aspects of the dataset, such as the distribution of margins, the performance of individual candidates, or the impact of different factors on the election results.

## Results and Insights
This project helps in understanding voting patterns, regional influences, and key statistics from the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
